CARDIAC VISUALISATION TECHNIQUES

Here you will find code, data and examples related to the talk.

SETUP AND DEPENDENCIES:
Many of the dependencies are optional. Often the easiest way to install is to use your favourite package manager e.g. aptitude, yum, MacPorts. Alternatively, download the source from the websites and follow the instructions for installation.

The code can be downloaded in zip or tar format from github.com/mattgibb/visualisation, but if you would like to keep up to date with the latest version easily, or to contribute a patch or extra tools and materials, you will need to install git (http://git-scm.com/). Further instructions are at github.com/mattgibb/visualisation.

For the file converter, you will need to install:

CMake (cmake.org)
VTK (vtk.org)
Boost (www.boost.org)

To run tests, you will need to install:

Python (www.python.org)

FILE CONVERSION
The file converter translates many popular cardiac file formats into VTK format, for viewing with e.g. ParaView. Once you've checked out the code, change into the 'file_converter/build' subdirectory and run:

ccmake ..

This will generate build files for you in an interactive way. If nothing goes wrong, you should be able simply to press 'c' for configure a couple of times, then 'g' for generate. The instructions are at the bottom of the screen anyway. You might need to tell it where VTK or Boost is installed if you've installed them in a non-standard location for your OS.

Once the makefiles are generated, just type make et voil√†! tetgen_to_vtk is built.

RUNNING TESTS:
To run the tests, change into 'file_converter/build/test' and type 'ctest'. All the tests should pass :)
